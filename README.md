# Project Name : jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

1. Create an application where you have the ability to input an employees informtion containing 
the employee's first name, last name, id, title and annually salary on an input form. 
2. A 'Submit' button should collect the form information, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color to the total monthly cost.
3. The output of this is that when you input the employee's information on the DOM, it will 
create a table roll containing all the employees information. 

What problem did you solve? 

How did you solve it?

1. I start the project by creating a html/script/css and jquery file and sourcing them all together. 
2. I then start on my html files by adding how I would want my DOM to look like first visually to see
how I would solve the probelm. I added inputs of each information input along with a button and table 
and assign some input with an id. 
3. After, I start working on the script files by creating a ready now document, making sure it works. 
I started out by creating an exsisting array of objects to see how each input will look like when added
to the DOM.
